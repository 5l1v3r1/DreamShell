DreamShell
==========

The Dreamshell is the operating system for the Sega Dreamcast.
It has a modular system, as well as a XML interface for creating applications in both C/C ++ and Lua script.
You can see many examples already in ready-made applications and modules. Also here there are unique drivers for different devices, formats and interfaces. Examples of simple decoding of audio and video, data compression, network stack, emulation, scripts, and more. From hardcore low-level assembler to high-level applications.
We are glad if this code will help someone, so we will be glad of your support too.
