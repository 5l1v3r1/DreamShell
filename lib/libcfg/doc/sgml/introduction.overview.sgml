&name; is a library for parsing command line arguments and/or configuration
files. Your program can utilize it whenever either kind of parsing is needed.
C was our language of choice, but a C++ wrapper is currently under development
and will be probably available soon.

This is one of the first releases of &name;. If you find a bug or missing
feature, please notify us and we will try to address the issue as soon as
possible. Also, let us know if you find typos or badly written portions of the
documentation. We are not native English speakers, but we are improving our
language skills every day!

There are two approaches to using &name;.

	<listitem>
		<para>

You can install it as a separate library and dynamically link your application
against it. If you are planning to distribute your application, you can always
use the <filename>./configure</filename> script included with the application
to detect whether &name; has been installed on the target system. If not, user
can be noticed to install this library. 

		</para>

		<para>
					
We are also working on the possibility of your application to check for the
installation of &name;. If it is determined that &name; does not exist on the
target system or is not the required version, it will be added to that system
automatically. Your application can then be properly compiled and linked.

		</para>
		<para>

We know that this is a little bit sophisticated thing with need of lot of
testing and improving on various systems and platforms. Detailed examples on
how to detect, install or reinstall &name; will be included. Please let us
know of your experience because it will help us streamline the process.

The other method of using &name; is to simply add the library source code to
your project source tree. In the example, the library source code can be put
into a subdirectory called <filename class="directory">&name;/</filename>.
Appropriate files of your application include the main library header file
<filename class="headerfile">cfg+.h</filename>. Then compile the library and
your sources and link everything together.

Some of the ideas used in this project were inspired by
<productname>popt</productname> (a command line parsing library) and
<productname>parsecfg</productname> (a library for parsing configuration
files). However &name; was written from scratch.
