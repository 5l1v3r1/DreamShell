libcfg+ installation notes
--------------------------

For full installation information refer to documentation located
in doc/html/ directory.

If you are impatient try this:

	1. Unpack archive (you probably already have this done)
	2. ./configure
	3. make
	4. make install

For non-GNU UNIX based systems (such as FreeBSD) you should use gmake
instead of make.
